## A personnal project

> For my astro Lovers <3

As an astronomy enthusiast, I felt compelled to create something dedicated to it. Therefore, I decided to develop a showcase website that highlights the beauty of astronomy. From nebulas to stars, planets to black holes, this project aims to illustrate the wonders of space. Join me in exploring the fascinating phenomena that occur beyond our atmosphere.


### Video Showcase

For this project, I've curated a collection of short videos showcasing the breathtaking beauty of astronomy. Each video captures the mesmerizing phenomena that unfold in the vast expanse of space.
